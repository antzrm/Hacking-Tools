# Hacking-Tools
Tools/Scripts I created from scratch or refine from others (credits to them)

**find_comments.sh** Find comments on websites by providing URL / JSON file (e.g. ffuf output) or file with full URLs and paths. Useful on assessments to detect hardcoded sensitive data or info left

**rpcenumauth** RPC enumeration tool that works with null creds but also supports authentication (credits to s4vitar)
